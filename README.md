# PHP2550_Project1

## Description
This project is a collaboration with Dr. Lauren Micalizzi from the Department Behavioral and Social Sciences at Brown University. Exposure to smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are two of the most ubiquitous and hazardous of children’s environmental exposures. This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of smoking during pregnancy and postpartum periods and examines effects of smoking prenatally and postnatally on adolescent’s externalizing behaviors, substance use and self-regulation.
